# Arduino-Grand-Central-M4
Sketches in support of a guitar pedal.

Currently soldering ICs and busses based on the Super Audio Board schematic.

- PWM using timer based interrupt.

- I2S using DMA transfers for CS4271.
  - Testing this by setting up an I2S slave (arduino due SAM3X8E) to send test bytes back and forth
  - Generating bit clock and frame clock on the Grand Central SAMD51.
  - Master clock will eventually be generated by an external crystal clock source.

- SPI controlled ILI9341 using DMA.
  - The XPT2046 Touch screen library is currently not working in conjunction with the Display.
    - Moving from the Adafruit_ili9341 library to the ili9341-t3 library by paul stoffregen.

- I2C controlled CS4271.
  - Wire.h
  - Comming soon.
